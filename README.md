-------------------ANSWER ----------------

1. Why is Java a platform-independent language?
Java is platform-independent because it compiles code into bytecode that can run on any platform with a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2. Why is Java not a pure object-oriented language?
Java includes primitive data types for performance reasons, which are not objects. In pure object-oriented languages, everything is an object.

3. What is JVM?
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It's responsible for executing Java bytecode and provides a runtime environment for Java applications.

4. What are the top Java Features?
Key Java features include platform independence, object-oriented nature, simplicity, robustness, security, multithreading, high performance, and a rich standard library.

5. Difference between JVM, JRE, and JDK.

JVM executes Java bytecode.
JRE includes JVM and libraries to run Java applications.
JDK includes JRE and development tools for creating Java applications.

6. Explain public static void main(String args[]) in Java.
It's the entry point for Java programs. public allows access from anywhere, static means it belongs to the class, void means no return value, main is the method name, and String args[] is for command-line arguments.

7. What happens if we don't declare main as static?
You'll get a compilation error. main must be static because it's called by the JVM before creating any class instances.

8. What are Packages in Java?
Packages organize related classes and interfaces in a hierarchical structure, helping manage and locate classes within Java projects. They're declared using the package keyword.

9. Why Packages are used?
Packages are used to organize classes, avoid naming conflicts, and improve code organization in Java.

10. Advantages of Packages in Java?
Packages provide organization, modularity, encapsulation, and prevent naming conflicts.

11. Types of packages in Java?
Built-in or standard packages, which are part of the Java API (e.g., java.util, java.io).

12. Supermost class in Java?
java.lang.Object is the top-level class in Java.

13. What is Java?
Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language.

14. Differences between C++ and Java?
Key differences include memory management, pointers, platform independence, inheritance, operator overloading, and exception handling.

15. static public void vs. public static void in Java?
The order of static and public doesn't matter; both are valid for the main method declaration
